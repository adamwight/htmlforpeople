# Intermission: upgrade your text editor

You’ve come a long way. Let’s take a second to appreciate that you opened up a simple text editor and created a freaking website by writing some HTML code. Way to go!

Speaking of simple text editors, it can get pretty annoying to keep everything indented nicely in HTML. And it can get difficult to distinguish HTML code from the content we’ve written.

It’s not terrible, but we can do better. Let’s download an editor that’s made for writing code.

{% aside 'Note' %}
I’m using Windows for this part just for kicks but everything I’m doing can be done on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
{% endaside %}

## Download Visual Studio Code

Head over to <https://code.visualstudio.com/>. This is a free code editor from Microsoft that works on Mac, Windows, and Linux. It can do a lot of things but we’re going to keep it nice and easy for this book.

Don’t let the busy screenshot on the homepage scare you. We don’t need all those advanced features for what we’re doing.

Once you download and install VS Code, start it up. You may see a few instructional screens but then you’ll be presented with a screen like this:

## Open your project

On the VS Code welcome screen, click _Open Folder_ then select the folder containing your web project. You’ll see your website files in the sidebar. When you open the `index.html` file, you’ll see your code in a nice view with line numbers and what is called *syntax highlighting*—parts of the code are colorized so that they are more easily distinguished from other parts.

VS Code also helps by making it easier to write code. It understands HTML and many other languages. When you start to type it will give you suggestions that you can autocomplete. It’ll also automatically indent for you when you press enter so that you don’t have to enter tabs or spaces manually.

VS Code opens your files in tabs. This is convenient later when your website has multiple pages.

{% aside 'Note' %}
VS Code lets lines of text scroll off the side of the page by default. If you would rather have text wrap to the next line, click the _View_ menu and choose _Word Wrap_.

## Explore when you’re ready

There are a lot of cool things VS Code can do but what we have covered here is enough to get you started. Think of it as a fancier Notepad. At the end of the day, it’s still just text in a file. We started our journey with Notepad or TextEdit just to show that you can make a website with simple tools you already have installed on your computer—no magic or expensive software required.

That said, using a code editor makes the HTML-writing process nicer and easier. And when you’re ready, you can explore all the features VS Code has to offer. Or even try other code editors to see how you like them.

For now, let’s get back to making our website!

## Up next

Now that we’ve leveled up our text editor, let’s learn how to add _style_ to our website.
