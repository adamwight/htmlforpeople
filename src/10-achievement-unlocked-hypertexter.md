# Achievement unlocked: Hypertexter

Congratulations to you—you made a freaking website using HTML! What started as a sentence or two written in Notepad became a full-blown, multipage website. You learned all sorts of stuff:

- Creating HTML pages
- Structuring content with headings and sections
- Linking to other webpages
- Formatting text
- Quoting text with block quotes
- Displaying data with tables
- Hiding content behind a clickable summary
- Creating secondary content with asides
- Embedding images
- Embedding video
- Using third-party web components
- Putting a website on the internet
- ...and more besides!

I hope you feel empowered to create your own custom websites. But even if you don’t create websites from scratch, knowing a bit of HTML is useful. Many content management systems give you the ability to put custom HTML on a page. Even just knowing how to use the `<a>` tag to create a link its own little superpower.

So, where to now?

## Bonus content

We’ve made it through the main stuff I wanted to cover in _HTML for People_. That said there are a few topics I'd like to expand upon as something of an appendix to the main series.

- **[[Customizing Simple.css]]**. Even without learning much CSS, you can change the appearance of your Simple site by overriding a few variables.
- **[[CSS basics]]**. We'll remove Simple.css and learn how to write our own basic page styles with CSS.
- **[[Reusable HTML with PHP]]**.  We'll take a look at how to reuse chunks of HTML—like a nav menu—by using PHP includes.
