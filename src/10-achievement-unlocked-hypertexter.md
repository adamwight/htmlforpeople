# Achievement unlocked: Hypertexter

Congratulations to you—you made a freaking website using HTML! What started as a sentence or two written in Notepad became a full-blown, multipage website. You learned all sorts of stuff:

- Creating HTML pages
- Structuring content with headings and sections
- Linking to other webpages
- Formatting text
- Quoting text with block quotes
- Displaying data with tables
- Hiding content behind a clickable summary
- Creating secondary content with asides
- Embedding images
- Embedding video
- Using third-party web components
- Putting a website on the internet
- ...and more besides!

I hope you feel empowered to create your own custom websites. But even if you don’t create websites from scratch, knowing a bit of HTML is useful. Many content management systems give you the ability to put custom HTML on a page. Even just knowing how to use the `<a>` tag to create a link its own little superpower.

So, where to now?

## Bonus chapters

We’ve made it through the main stuff I wanted to cover in _HTML for People_. That said there are a few topics I'd like to expand upon as something of an appendix to the main book.

- **[Customizing Simple.css](/customizing-simple-css)**. Even without learning much CSS, you can change the appearance of your Simple site by overriding a few variables.
- **[CSS basics](/css-basics)**. Moving on from the Simple site, this side quest teaches you how to make a nicely designed webpage from scratch using CSS.
- **[Reusable HTML with PHP](/reusable-html-with-php)**.  We'll take a look at how to reuse chunks of HTML—like a nav menu—by using PHP includes. This is a programming-lite introduction to dynamic websites.

## Resources from this book

I peppered in quite a few links along the way, pointing you to various demos and documentation. For convenience, here is a list of the main ones.

### HTML for People

- **[Blake's Homepage demo](https://demo.htmlforpeople.com/)**. This is my version of the site this book teaches you how to make. If you followed along and made your own site, [I'd love to here about it](https://blakewatson.com/about/#contact-me).
- **[Blake’s Homepage source code](https://github.com/blakewatson/htmlforpeopledemo)**. This is the code repository for the demo site. Here you can browse all the code and download it if you'd like.
- **[Blake’s Homepage, PHP version](https://github.com/blakewatson/htmlforpeopledemo/tree/php)**. This is another version of the source code where I converted the site to PHP as described in the bonus chapter, [Reusable HTML with PHP](/reusable-html-with-php).
- **[Planets of the Solar System demo](https://planets.htmlforpeople.com/)**. This is a demo of the page we'll build in the bonus chapter, [CSS basics](/css-basics).
- **[Planets of the Solar System source code](https://github.com/blakewatson/css-basics)**. This is the code repository for said webpage.

### Helpful resources and documentation

- **[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org)**. If you need the details about a particular HTML tag, CSS property, or other specific technical info, this is the best place to get it. MDN is more or less the official user manual to website making.
- **[Neocities](https://neocities.org/)** and [Neocities FAQs](https://neocities.org/contact). This is the web hosting service I chose to use in the book because it’s free and has a similar ethos (people-focused website creation). The FAQs have a lot of good information and insight into the service if you want more info about them.
- **[Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/)**. This is the CSS framework we used throughout the book. They've got docs on how to use Simple.css as well as a demo of various HTML elements.
- **[Butterick's Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/)**. An excellent book about typography and design. If you’re short on time, check out [Typography in ten minutes](https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html).
- **[EntityCode](https://entitycode.com/)**. This is a reference of *HTML entities* you can use to reproduce special characters and symbols.
- **[Coolers color contrast checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker)**. A nice tool for making sure your text and background colors have enough contrast to be legible.

### Web hosts for static websites

In addition to Neocities, there are some other good choices for hosting your HTML websites.

- **[Yay.boo](https://yay.boo/):** Silly name, really easy website publishing. You just drag and drop a folder and pick a name and your website is online.
- **[Glitch](https://glitch.com/):** This is a good option if you want to code everything directly in the browser. Build it then publish.
- **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/):** More sophisticated, but has a [drag-and-drop-folder-to-publish](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#drag-and-drop) feature and gives you more developer-centric features.
