  <h1>HTML for is people</h1>

  <p>
    HTML isn't only for people working in the tech field. It's for anybody, the
    way documents are for anybody. HTML is just another type of document. A very
    special oneâ€”the one the web is built on.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm Blake Watson. I've been building websites since the early 2000s. Though
    I work professionally in the field, I feel strongly that you should be able
    to make a website with HTML if you want. This book will teach you just that.
    It doesn't require any previous experience making websites or coding. I will
    cover everything you need to know to get started in a approachable and
    friendly way.
